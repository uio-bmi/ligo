Use case examples
================================

This page provides examples on how LIgO can be used to validate AIRR-ML approaches. All use cases assume you have LIgO already installed. For details on how to do that, see :ref:`Installing LIgO`.


The LIgO manuscript showcases LIgO on two use cases. The following sections provide a description of how to reproduce these use cases.

1. :ref:`Out-of-distribution receptor-level simulation using LIgO`

2. :ref:`Limitations of conventional encoding schemes for repertoire-level binary classification when immune signals co-occur within the same AIR`
