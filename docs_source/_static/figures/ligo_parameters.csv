Generative models for simulation of background AIRs,"ExperimentalImport provides import of existing experimental data of one of the following data formats: AIRR, Generic, IGoR, IReceptor, ImmuneML, ImmunoSEQRearrangement, ImmunoSEQSample, MiXCR, OLGA, SingleLineReceptor, TenxGenomics, VDJdb",These parameters relate biologically to germline gene usage differences across individuals as previously shown by us and others (Glanville et al. 2011; Slabodkin et al. 2021).,https://uio-bmi.github.io/ligo/specification.html#experimentalimport
,"OLGA provides simulation of synthetic AIRs using a V(D)J recombination model, including a user-defined custom model",,https://uio-bmi.github.io/ligo/specification.html#olga
Motif definition,"SeedMotif describes a motif using a (i) seed (the initial k-mer) and (ii) allowed deviations from the seed. The allowed deviations can be described with allowed gap length (min_gap, max_gap), distribution of number of allowed mismatches to the seed (hamming_distance_probabilities), distribution of mismatches across the seed positions (position_weights), and substitution probabilities for nucleotides or amino acid (alphabet_weights)","Can be used to describe antigen-binding motifs, which are present in signal-specfic AIRs as was previously observed by us and others (Akbar et al. 2021; Shrock et al. 2023; Ostmeyer et al. 2019; Shugay et al. 2018; Goncharov et al. 2022; Chronister et al. 2021)",https://uio-bmi.github.io/ligo/specification.html#seedmotif
,PWM — motif described in a form of a positional weight matrix,,https://uio-bmi.github.io/ligo/specification.html#pwm
Signal definition,Motifs — several motifs within an immune signal,"Relates to motifs co-occurrence within the same AIR (2 motifs max), since immune signals may comprise multiple co-occurring motifs within the same AIR (Akbar et al. 2021; Glanville et al. 2017; Dash et al. 2017)",https://uio-bmi.github.io/ligo/specification.html#signal
,Sequence_position_weights describes signal distribution across CDR3 IMGT positions,"Helps preserve the conservative start and end of CDR3, and controls a motif predominance in a specific location within CDR3",
,"V_call, J_call restrict the V or J gene (allele) in the immune signal","Relates to previous observations that some signal-specific AIRs are associated with a specific germline gene alleles (Feeney et al. 1996; Avnir et al. 2016; Liu and Lucas 2003; Imkeller et al. 2018; Fagiani, Catanzaro, and Lanni 2020)",
,"Clonal_frequency describes clonal frequency distribution, can be defined separately for each group of immune signals",Relates to previous observation by us and others that clonal frequency distributions may change across immune statuses (Greiff et al. 2015; Chiffelle et al. 2020).,
,"Custom signal function (source_file, is_present_func) — any user-defined function which takes as arguments motifs, v_call, j_call, and sequence_position_weights",Helps to define any custom immune signal,
Parameters related to a group of receptors or repertoires,Signals — distribution of signals across the simulated AIRs,Helps increase complexity of simulated data,https://uio-bmi.github.io/ligo/specification.html#simulation-config-item
,Is_noise indicates if a group of signal-specific AIRs should be labeled as not signal-specific,Relates to experimental artifacts that may occur under imperfect experimental conditions,
,Generative_model defines V(D)J model for a given set of AIRs,Helps increase complexity of simulated data and control gene allele distribution of signal-specific AIRs,
,"False_positives_prob_in_receptors, false_negative_prob_in_receptors percentage of false positive or false negative AIRs when performing repertoire-level simulation",Relates to experimental artifacts that may occur under imperfect experimental conditions,
,"Immune_events — receptor or repertoire-level labels, which can be later used for AIRR-ML","Relates to diseases, vaccinations, allergies, etc, which elicit immune responses",
,Default_clonal_frequency — clonal frequency distribution for background AIRs,Relates to previous observation by us and others that clonal frequency distributions may change across immune statuses (Greiff et al. 2015; Chiffelle et al. 2020).,
,Sequence_len_limits restricts minimal and maximal CDR3 lengths to be included in the simulated data,"Relates to length biases observed in signal-specific AIRs (Haakenson, Huang, and Smider 2018; Roark et al. 2021)",
Parameters of the simulation,Is_repertoire defines receptor or repertoire level of simulation,Relates to different types of available AIRR data,https://uio-bmi.github.io/ligo/specification.html#simulation-config
,Paired defines how to pair the output data,,
,Sequence_type — defines the nucleotide or amino acid type of simulated AIRs,,
,Species — human (default) or mouse,,
,"Keep_p_gen_dist implements importance sampling, i.e., subsample signal-specific AIRs with respect to pgen distribution of background AIRs","Relates to previous observations by us and other that found marked differences in pgen and clonal frequency which may relate to immune signal (Kanduri et al., n.d.; Pogorelyy et al. 2019)",
,Remove_seqs_with_signals filters signal-specific AIRs from the background if True,Helps to control the exact number of signal-specific receptors within a set of AIRs (if True) or make simulated data more complex (if False),
