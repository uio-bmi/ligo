@dataclass
class SimConfigItem:
    """
    When performing a SimConfig, one or more implantings can be specified. An implanting represents
    a set of signals which are implanted in a RepertoireDataset with given rates.

    Multiple implantings may be specified in one simulation. In this case, each implanting will only
    affect its own partition of the dataset, so each repertoire can only receive implanted signals from
    one implanting. This way, implantings can be used to ensure signals do not overlap (one implanting per
    signal), or to ensure signals always occur together (multiple signals per implanting).


    Arguments:

        signal_proportions (dict): signals for the simulation item and the proportion of sequences in the repertoire that will have the given signal. For receptor-level simulation, the proportion will always be 1.

        is_noise (bool): indicates whether the implanting should be regarded as noise; if it is True, the signals will be implanted as specified, but
        the repertoire/receptor in question will have negative class.

        generative_model: parameters of the generative model, including its type, path to the model

        seed (int): starting random seed for the generative model (ideally should differ across simulation items)

        false_positives_prob_in_receptors (float): when doing repertoire level simulation, what percentage of sequences should be false positives

        false_negative_prob_in_receptors (float): when doing repertoire level simulation, what percentage of sequences should be false negatives

        immune_events (dict): a set of key-value pairs that will be added to the metadata (same values for all data generated in one simulation sim_item) and can be later used as labels

        default_clonal_frequency (dict): clonal frequency in Ligo is simulated through `scipy's zeta distribution function for generating random numbers <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.zipf.html>`_, with parameters provided under default_clonal_frequency parameter. These parameters will be used to assign count values to sequences that do not contain any signals if they are required by the simulation. If clonal frequency shouldn't be used, this parameter can be None

                clonal_frequency:
                    a: 2 # shape parameter of the distribution
                    loc: 0 # 0 by default but can be used to shift the distribution

        sequence_len_limits (dict): allows for filtering the generated sequences by length, needs to have parameters min and max specified; if not used, min/max should be -1
